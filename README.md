# SAC-CAS GPS Track

Firefox addon, that adds button for download GPS track of the route.

# Known issues

SAC CAS route page(for instance https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts-and-tours/sac-route-portal/11049/ski_tour/7235) contains few segments. For now Addon will create .GPX file with all the segments from the page, but Strava/Garmin Connect sowtware will display only first one.
